/**
 * ASTNodeOrigin contains contextual information about the object from whose
 * definition a particular ASTNode originated. For example, suppose a view v is
 * defined as <code>select x+1 as y from t</code>, and we're processing a query
 * <code>select v1.y from v as v1</code>, and there's a type-checking problem
 * with the expression <code>x+1</code> due to an ALTER TABLE on t subsequent to
 * the creation of v. Then, when reporting the error, we want to provide the
 * parser location with respect to the definition of v (rather than with respect
 * to the top-level query, since that represents a completely different
 * "parser coordinate system").
 *
 *<p>
 *
 * So, when expanding the definition of v while analyzing the top-level query,
 * we tag each ASTNode with a reference to an ASTNodeOrigin describing v and its
 * usage within the query.
